\section{Reimplementation Results} \label{sec:reimplementation-results}

Figure \ref{fig:original_plot} shows the results from the original paper and Figure \ref{fig:combined_plot} shows the reimplementation results.
It can be seen that both plots show the same trajectory for the fitness over the series of function evaluations for each algorithm and fitness function combination.
The reimplementation plots are slightly rougher due to the lower number of experiments used to calculate the average performance.
