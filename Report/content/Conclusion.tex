\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this assignment the paper titled \citetitle*{original-paper}\cite{original-paper} was reimplemented successfully in Python.
An extension was added to try to determine the source of the performance increase in the Cooperative Coevolutionary Genetic Algorithm (CCGA).
This extension attempted to imitate the crossover scheme enabled by the CCGA in a standard Genetic Algorithm (GA) to rule that out as a significant performance booster.
This attempt was partially successful, in that the extended algorithms proved marginally better in some problems and marginally worse in others.
