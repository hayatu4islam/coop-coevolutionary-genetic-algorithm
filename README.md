# Cooperative Coevolutionary Genetic Algorithm Implementation
This repo contains a Python reimplementation and extension of a paper titled *A cooperative Cooevolutionary Approach to Function Optimisation*.
This paper can be found [here](https://cs.gmu.edu/~mpotter/pubs/ppsn94.pdf).
The project is discussed in detail in the [Project Report](Report.pdf).

This project was submitted for the award of an MEng in Electronics with Computer Systems during my 4th year at the University of Southampton.

<!-- Genetic Algorithms use the principals of evolution by natural selection to solve optimisation problems. 
A set of individuals, each containing a possible solution to an optimisation problem encoded as binary string (its DNA).
The quality of each individual's solution determines its fitness.
The algorithm pits individuals against each other in a "survival of the fittest" competition.
The winners are allowed to reproduce, creating a new generation of individuals with DNA taken from each parent, along with a small number of mutations. 
With a correctly tuned algorithm, the   -->
